# optimal_decisions
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my passion for automated optimal decision making under uncertainity. My research interests are in engineering agents that can automatically make intelligent decisions. <br>
This document showcases some modern Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) algorithms <br>
.ipynb file contains code to demonstrate the MCDA algorithms discussed in the paper can easily be run through google collab through google drive<br>
.pdf file contains the research paper <br>
.ppt is a power point presentation that briefly goes over the findings of the paper <br>
This project is a work in progress. Polishing will be done at the end. I am currently studying Game Theory, Many-Objective Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Methods that take uncertainty into account. My short-term goal is to demonstrate several algorithms in such fields. My long-term goal is to use these methods for making an automated decision making agent <br>
I would love to hear your feedback. A video presentation is also available on request. Please do not hesistate to reach me at sazarta1@jh.edu
