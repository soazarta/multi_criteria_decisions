# optimal_decisions
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my passion for automated optimal decision making under uncertainity.<br>
My research interests are in engineering agents that can automatically make intelligent decisions.
This document showcases some modern Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) algorithms <br>
.ipynb file contains code to demonstrate the MCDA algorithms discussed in the paper can easily be run through google collab through google drive<br>
.pdf file contains the research paper <br>
.ppt is a power point presentation that briefly goes over the findings of the paper <br>
A video presentation is also available on request. Email at sazarta1@jh.edu <br>
This project is a work in progress. Polishing will be done at the end.<br>
I am currently studying Game Theory, Many-Objective Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Methods that take uncertainty into account. Briefly, I plan on using reinforcement learning to update objective functions for a Normal Game while attempting to quantify aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.<br>
